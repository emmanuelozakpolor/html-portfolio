<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. My name is Emmanuel Ozakpolor and I am a software developer. I have been in the tech space as a software
  developer for about six months and counting. Some of my favourite programming tools and languages are html5, css3, 
  javascript, tailwind, nodjs, react, vscode, mql4, metaeditor and github. I do enjoy my time as a developer and I am
   always researching to know the current market trend. 

  My main focus as a developer is expert advisers, web sites and web apps. I split my time in-between projects to get 
  the most of my work done. I enjoy being a software developer and what i have achieved in the short time i have been 
  engaged in projects is so interesting.</p>

<p>Some of my projects as stated earlier are expert advisers for forex trading and web sites and web apps for businesses. I have 
  some of my projects saved in my github repository. Its been quite an interesting journey i must confess. Though i 
  still have lots to learn, I am eager to learn more and accomplish a lot.
</p>

<p>My major challenges as a developer is deciphering new codes. I noticed that as difficult as that is sometimes, 
  I find myself enthused to take on more of it. I look forward to getting better, working with expert developers, 
  designing systems and softwares that will help a lot of customers, companies and societies and taking on more challenges.</p>
